This project including work with ORM library for java ( Hibernate ).
All the functions use HQL (Hibernate Query Language), which works with persistent objects and their properties.
HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turn perform an action on the database. 
Hibernate does persistent components using XML mapping or by using @ annotation in the code itself, in this project the work with hibernate will be done by XML files.
